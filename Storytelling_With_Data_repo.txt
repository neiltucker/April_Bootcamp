"structures that organize data into rows and columns"
Pros:
Easy to build
Works with any type of data
Good support for charts
Shows detailed information
Cons:
Slower to understand vs visual data presentation methods
Limited usefulness in representing large datasets in presentations


2. Line Graph: https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2020/3/24/what-is-a-line-graph
"uses lines to show how data values change over time."
Pros:
Easy to understand
Show trending / forecasting data
Highlight anomalies
Cons:
Not best for displaying quantities
Better options for showing categorical data
Showing data subsets


3. Bar Chart: https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2020/2/19/what-is-a-bar-chart
"used to graphically represent grouped or categorical data"
Pros:
Easy to read
Widely used
Display same data in different formats
Display relative proportions for categories
Summarize large datasets
Cons:
Easy to manipulate
May oversimplify data


4. Pie Chart: https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2020/5/14/what-is-a-pie-chart
"pie charts use a segmented circle to show a part-to-whole relationship between categories in a dataset"
Pros:
Demonstrate relative size of data segments
Works well with datasets that have few categories
Cons:
Many categories reduce the useful of the chart


5. Heat Maps: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map
"graphical representation of data that uses colors to show relative data values"
Pros:
Easy to demonstrate conclusions
Can demonstrate trends
Summarize large datasets
Can be combined with other chart types (e.g. Maps or Bar Charts)
Quickly identify areas of interest
Cons:
Color schemes can be misleading


6. Maps: https://docs.tibco.com/pub/spotfire/7.0.1/doc/html/map_60/map_60_what_is_a_map_chart.htm
"show the geographic context for data" 
Pros:
Shows how location affects data distribution
Easily compare activity in different locations
Easily understood by audiences
Cons:
Only one field can be plotted per map


7. Treemaps: https://www.anychart.com/chartopedia/chart-type/treemap/
"Show the relative size of different elements in a dataset by using nested, colored, rectangles"
Pros:
Easily see size differences between elements in a dataset
Allows the use of multiple data elements
Efficiently uses space in the chart
Cons:
Size distortions are possible
Limited useful when precise comparisons are needed


8. Circle View: https://interworks.com/blog/ccapitula/2014/10/17/tableau-essentials-chart-types-circle-view/
"Uses symbols (like circles) to represent and compare categories of data using multiple data measures"
Pros:
Include multiple measures in a chart to analyze data
Quickly find useful data points for further analysis
Uses size and color to make data elements stand out
Cons:
May become too complicated
Too many data elements may obscure important information


9. Scatter Plot: https://interworks.com/blog/ccapitula/2014/11/21/tableau-essentials-chart-types-scatter-plot
"Finds patterns by examining two data measures"
Pros:
Uses multiple measures to analyze data
Can quickly illustrate correlations in data
Cons:
Only two variables can be used
Correlations found cannot be measured quantitatively in the chart


10. Histogram: https://interworks.com/blog/ccapitula/2014/11/26/tableau-essentials-chart-types-histogram
"Uses a bar chart to show the distribution of a data measure"
Pros:
Only a single measure is needed
The value of the data can be enhanced by adding other data elements
Cons:
Using only a single measure may scew results and interpretations
The results depend largerly on the number of data segments (bins) the measure is divided into


11. Box Plott: https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-boxplots-5e2df7bcbd51
"Graphically shows the variability and dispersion of data in one or more datasets.
Pros:
Summarizes variations in large datasets
Quickly illustrates how data is distributed, including outliers
Cons:
Outlier information can be misinterpreted
Clusters in the dataset may not be obvious in the graph


12. Gantt Chart: https://interworks.com/blog/ccapitula/2014/12/18/tableau-essentials-chart-types-gantt-chart
"Used to visualize schedules for tasks.  Often used in project management."
Pros:
Easily see how long a task will take
Makes planning related tasks easier
Easily see how changes in one task will affect others
Cons:
Too many tasks make them too complex to understand
Actual hours worked not accurately represented in the chart


13. Bullet Graph: https://interworks.com/blog/ccapitula/2014/12/29/tableau-essentials-chart-types-bullet-graph
"A type of bar chart which uses indicators to show progress toward a goal.  Used mainly for performance data."
Pros:
Quickly indicate progress toward to a goal
Can be used to compare progress of multiple measures
Cons:
Too much data may distract users


14. Bubble Charts: https://interworks.com/blog/ccapitula/2015/01/06/tableau-essentials-chart-types-packed-bubbles
"A type of scatter plot that uses uses three or more data measures"
Pros:
Use three or more data elements in a single graph
Easy to understand
Cons:
Exact values may be difficult to read
Too many data points may make the chart too complex to understand
